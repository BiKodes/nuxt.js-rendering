# Project Architecture

Projects are based on modular architecture with drill down to separation of concern design principle.

The root off all projects have a ```nuxt.config.ts`` file. This is strictly reserved for TYPESCRIPT. The file can also be used to host environment viriables such as API Keys,

The default root component of the application is the ```app.vue``` file  

The nuxt folder is used by nuxt.js during development to generate the nuxt application adn you don't need to go exploring it or changing anything within that folder.

# Running Project

You can run the projects locally by running the following command on the terminal:

    ```npm run dev```
