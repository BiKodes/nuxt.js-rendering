            If you compare how product pages take shape across different companies, 
            it's clear they run the gamut. Some go for the direct approach, displaying 
            an image of a product and explaining why someone should buy it. 
            
            Other companies create elaborate pages with moving parts and fancy, interactive 
            elements.
